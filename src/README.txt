# Prado Editor â€“ Implementation Layer (CPP Files)

This directory contains the implementation files for the Prado Editor application. These source files define the core business logic, user interface behavior, and image processing functionality.

## Files

### `main.cpp`
Handles application entry point. Loads artwork metadata from a CSV, populates the global gallery, tests filter and sort functionality, and launches the UI via `PradoEditor`.

### `managers.cpp`
Implements the `ArtworkManager` and `EditorManager` methods. Handles:

- Loading and caching images
- Applying filters (grayscale, invert, blur)
- Cropping and rotating images
- Resetting image to original

### `artwork.cpp`
Implements support functions for parsing artwork metadata and initializing the `Artwork` struct. Contains parsing logic for CSV fields.

### `image_cache.cpp`
Manages caching of OpenCV `cv::Mat` images using a static map. Provides fast retrieval and ensures only one copy of each image is held in memory.

### `image_scroll_gallery.cpp`
Implements a Qt widget (`ImageScrollGallery`) to show artwork images in a grid view. Supports scrolling and updating visible images dynamically.

### `prado_editor.cpp`
Implements the main application window setup. Connects the UI defined in Qt Designer to the rest of the application logic.

## Architecture

The application separates concerns clearly:

- `main.cpp` handles orchestration and runtime logic.
- `managers.cpp` deals with image editing logic.
- `artwork.cpp` parses structured data from CSV.
- `image_scroll_gallery.cpp` and `prado_editor.cpp` implement the user interface.

This structure supports easy maintenance, expansion, and testing of components.
