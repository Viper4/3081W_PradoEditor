## Contents
1. **`smallerpaintings.csv`**

Description: A subset of the [ Prado Museum Pictures Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maparla/prado-museum-pictures),    containing 50 rows of painting data. It includes multiple columns containing metadata about paintings, such as their titles,       descriptions, and image URLs. It provides structured data to be assigned to `Artwork` class instances defined in `artwork.h`.

2. **clean_smallerpaintings.csv`**

Description: A cleaned version of smallerpaintings.csv generated by the `csv_fixer.py`. Removes columns/attributes that are irrelevant to this project, for faster parsing and efficient storage.

3. **`csv_fixer.py`**

Description: A Python script to trim and structure the `smallerpaintings.csv` and output `clean_smallerpaintings.csv`. 

## **NOTE:** 
These CSV files are used for testing purposes *only*. Database integration and dynamic url queries will be implemented in the final product version to allow users full access to the Prado's painting collection.

## Limitations
`csv_fixer.py` is designed exclusively to clean and preprocess `smallerpaintings.csv`. It is not intended for user application on other datasets.
